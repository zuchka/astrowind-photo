        A lithe and nubile woman stands in the Sensei Great
        Hall. She looks down and to the left in a demure sort of
        way, hiding her face with her forearm.

        Koons' Aphrodite is based on a porcelain
        figurine designed by Elly Strobach König for the
        Czechoslovakian Royal Dux Company. Now greatly
        enlarged and polished to a mirror finish, Aphrodite
        transforms into a shimmering ideal. At Sensei, she also
        becomes a point of reflection for guests: on beauty, on
        identity, and on the human form.
