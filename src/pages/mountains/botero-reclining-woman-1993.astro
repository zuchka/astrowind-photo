        In the shade of the banyan, near the wide lanai
        that snakes around the old Ranch house, we find
        the first of three reclining women by Botero.
        <br><br>
        The recumbent nude, as it is sometimes known,
        is a theme as old as antiquity. Botero works from
        that great tradition, which has always embraced
        the body, but his reclining women are especially
        confident and self-possessed. With that hand
        behind her head, note how the Woman’s chest
        now heaves toward the canopy. It looks as if she
        were about to sigh, lazing on that pile of thick,
        flowing drapery.

  <ArtistBio
    artist="FERNANDO BOTERO"
    lifespan="1932 - 2023"
    nationality="Columbian"
    description=`
      Fernando Botero’s signature style of creating sculptures
      with exaggerated and inflated features, suggesting
      political criticism and satire, coined a new term in the
      art world: “Boterismo.”
      <br><br>
      The Columbian artist, well known
      for representing women, men, daily life, and historical
      events with wit and irony, began his career as a painter
      experimenting with proportion and size with his
      paintings of round, corpulent humans, before switching
      to sculpture in the 1970s.
