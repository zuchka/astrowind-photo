        In the shade of the banyan, near the wide lanai
        that snakes around the old Ranch house, we find
        the first of three reclining women by Botero.
        <br><br>
        The recumbent nude, as it is sometimes known,
        is a theme as old as antiquity. Botero works from
        that great tradition, which has always embraced
        the body, but his reclining women are especially
        confident and self-possessed. With that hand
        behind her head, note how the Woman’s chest
        now heaves toward the canopy. It looks as if she
        were about to sigh, lazing on that pile of thick,
        flowing drapery.
