      description: `
        Baltasar Lobo often represented mothers and
        children. Before the first Hale we find Baltasar
        Lobo’s Young Girl Brushing Her Hair. The scene
        of a young woman at her toilette is a common one
        in Western art. Lobo’s friend and contemporary,
        Pablo Picasso, enjoyed the motif greatly.
        <br><br>
        Caressing her long, thickly plaited hair, we find
        this young woman engaged in self-care. There is
        a sense of nurturing in much of Lobo’s work; and
        nurturing is what one will always find inside these
        Hales.

      Baltasar Lobo was a Spanish artist known for his
      sculptures depicting the female form. He became part
      of the avant-garde in Paris, befriending Pablo Picasso
      and artist Henri Laurens and showing at galleries
      with Matisse and Leger.

      He was influenced by Paris’s modernist art scene as well as ancient art and sculpture,
      which is reflected in his abstract forms.
