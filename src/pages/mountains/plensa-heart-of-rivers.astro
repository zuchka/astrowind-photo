        Nestled into a palm grove we find seven seated
        men. They are hugging their tucked-in knees,
        which in turn are framing a palm trunk. They
        embrace the tree, while their faces nearly touch
        its surface. As Heart of Rivers grows, so does this
        interaction. 
        <br><br>
        Each sculpture, a self-portrait of the
        artist Jaume Plensa, is covered in text in raised
        relief. Like the Polynesian tradition of tattoo, the
        names of great rivers cover their bodies. We hear
        a flowing creek nearby. We are left, perhaps, to
        contemplate how energy channels up a trunk, or
        down a stream.
