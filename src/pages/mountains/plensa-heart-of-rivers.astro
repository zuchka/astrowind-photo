        Nestled into a palm grove we find seven seated
        men. They are hugging their tucked-in knees,
        which in turn are framing a palm trunk. They
        embrace the tree, while their faces nearly touch
        its surface. As Heart of Rivers grows, so does this
        interaction. 
        <br><br>
        Each sculpture, a self-portrait of the
        artist Jaume Plensa, is covered in text in raised
        relief. Like the Polynesian tradition of tattoo, the
        names of great rivers cover their bodies. We hear
        a flowing creek nearby. We are left, perhaps, to
        contemplate how energy channels up a trunk, or
        down a stream.

  <ArtistBio
    artist="JAUME PLENSA"
    lifespan="1955 - "
    nationality="Spanish"
    description=`
      Born in Barcelona, Jaume Plensa is best known for his
      sculptures of human faces, heads and figures. Much
      of his work is designed to be displayed and interacted
      with in public spaces as a means of unifying individuals.
      <br><br>
      Plensa frequently weaves words and numbers into his work. He also
      blends conventional materials with unconventional
      media such as water, light and sound as a reflection of
      energy and human connection.
