        Guillaume Castel’s Cocoface greets us as we
        enter the inner garden. The weathering steel,
        (often called COR-TEN) exterior is coarse and
        gritty, whereas the painted lime-green interior is
        bright and smooth. It’s as if the steel really were
        a rough husk that had been cleaved to expose a
        bright, exuberant flesh.
        <br><br>
        Like Botero’s Dancers, balance seems critical
        here, only Cocoface is balancing two extreme
        environments. And in that way, the sculpture
        recalls the very island of Lāna'i: a place rugged yet
        beautiful; rough, yet lush.

      Guillaume Castel is a French-born sculptor who lives and
      works in Plouégat-Guérand, France. He uses natural and
      organic shapes and materials such as wood, concrete,
      brass and steel to depict nature and landscapes from his
      home region of Brittany. 
      <br><br>
      Geometrical shapes designed in
      raw materials describe nature, its fragility and elegance.
