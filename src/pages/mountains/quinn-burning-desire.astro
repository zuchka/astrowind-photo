        The inherent sensuality of nature is highlighted
        in Marc Quinn’s monumental Burning Desire,
        a painted bronze sculpture representing
        a phalaenopsis orchid. The scale and
        monumentality of the object has a transformative
        effect on the space.
        <br><br>
        Walk along the pond’s edge and investigate this
        massive flower, much like a honeybee in search of
        nectar.
