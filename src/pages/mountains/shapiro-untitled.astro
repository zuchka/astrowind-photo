        Joel Shapiro’s abstract geometric works have
        marked him as a pioneer of modern sculpture
        since the 1970s. Inspired by the body in motion,
        Shapiro’s Untitled, like so many other works
        here, challenges our sense of how we occupy
        space.
        <br><br>
        Canted to one side, the work achieves a
        delicate balance. With such poise, it’s only fitting
        that Untitled should stand so near Sensei’s yoga
        pavilion.
