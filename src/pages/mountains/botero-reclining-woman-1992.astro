        With that same hand behind her head and that
        same unflappable confidence, Botero’s second
        Reclining Woman twists up to meet our gaze.
        There is that trademark playfulness, yes, but so
        often Botero captures something more—a kind
        of insistent focus. 
        <br><br>
        These figures, if nothing else,
        seem intent on doing whatever it is we’ve caught
        them doing. Botero’s work, much like the larger
        Sensei mission, is one great study in mindfulness.

  <ArtistBio
    artist="FERNANDO BOTERO"
    lifespan="1932 - 2023"
    nationality="Columbian"
    description=`
      Fernando Botero’s signature style of creating sculptures
      with exaggerated and inflated features, suggesting
      political criticism and satire, coined a new term in the
      art world: “Boterismo.”
      <br><br>
      The Columbian artist, well known
      for representing women, men, daily life, and historical
      events with wit and irony, began his career as a painter
      experimenting with proportion and size with his
      paintings of round, corpulent humans, before switching
      to sculpture in the 1970s.
