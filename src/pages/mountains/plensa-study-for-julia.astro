    lifespan="1955 - "
    nationality="Spanish"
    description=`
      Born in Barcelona, Jaume Plensa is best known for his
      sculptures of human faces, heads and figures. Much
      of his work is designed to be displayed and interacted
      with in public spaces as a means of unifying individuals.
      <br><br>
      Plensa frequently weaves words and numbers into his work. He also
      blends conventional materials with unconventional
      media such as water, light and sound as a reflection of
      energy and human connection.
