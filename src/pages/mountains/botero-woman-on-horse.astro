        We approach Woman on Horse from the animal’s
        hind quarters, circling around its haunches until
        the rider’s face appears. Her face is round and
        smooth, whereas her steed’s is boxy and sharp.
        <br><br>
        There is a silliness and whimsy to this horse,
        with its elephantine legs and compressed body.
        It recalls the miniature ponies that graze the
        pastures of Lāna'i Ranch—the very place where
        this woman and her mount seem poised to ride.

  <ArtistBio
    artist="FERNANDO BOTERO"
    lifespan="1932 - 2023"
    nationality="Columbian"
    description=`
      Fernando Botero’s signature style of creating sculptures
      with exaggerated and inflated features, suggesting
      political criticism and satire, coined a new term in the
      art world: “Boterismo.”
      <br><br>
      The Columbian artist, well known
      for representing women, men, daily life, and historical
      events with wit and irony, began his career as a painter
      experimenting with proportion and size with his
      paintings of round, corpulent humans, before switching
      to sculpture in the 1970s.
