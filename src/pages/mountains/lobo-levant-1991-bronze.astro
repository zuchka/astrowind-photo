        Before another Hale we encounter the second of
        Lobo’s L’Île du Levant, only this one has a different
        patination. She reflects lights, rather than
        absorbing it, like its matte green twin. The former,
        in turn, demands attention, whereas the latter
        blends into a lush copse of ferns.

    description=`
      Baltasar Lobo was a Spanish artist known for his
      sculptures depicting the female form. He became part
      of the avant-garde in Paris, befriending Pablo Picasso
      and artist Henri Laurens and showing at galleries
      with Matisse and Leger. 
      <br><br>
      He was influenced by Paris’s modernist art scene as well as ancient art and sculpture,
      which is reflected in his abstract forms.
