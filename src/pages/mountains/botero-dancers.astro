        They stand perfectly erect, Botero’s Dancers.
        They are rigid, yes, but not stiff. We have caught
        them during a quiet moment in some, exacting
        pas de deux. These are, instead, two bodies in
        perfect control, with perfect balance.

  <ArtistBio
    artist="FERNANDO BOTERO"
    lifespan="1932 - 2023"
    nationality="Columbian"
    description=`
      Fernando Botero’s signature style of creating sculptures
      with exaggerated and inflated features, suggesting
      political criticism and satire, coined a new term in the
      art world: “Boterismo.”
      <br><br>
      The Columbian artist, well known
      for representing women, men, daily life, and historical
      events with wit and irony, began his career as a painter
      experimenting with proportion and size with his
      paintings of round, corpulent humans, before switching
      to sculpture in the 1970s.
