        The sheer exuberance and voluptuousness of
        Botero’s third Reclining Woman is undeniable.
        She is unabashed. Her forms are voluminous and
        exaggerated, and yet those torqueing limbs feel
        soft and buoyant—never inert or leaden.
        <br><br>
        While Botero’s second Woman sits up, his third
        lies down. Sometimes the massiveness of these
        forms can camouflage their detail. Note this
        Woman’s stylized hair, itself reduced to parallel
        grooves, and how that creates a powerful
        abstraction. She, Botero’s final figure, welcomes
        us to Sensei’s inner garden.
