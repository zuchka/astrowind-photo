        Claude Lalanne’s Pomme d’Hiver represents the
        second work by a woman artist in this sculpture
        collection and the last of its apples. Standing near
        Lalanne’s Winter Apple, we can make out Donna
        Seduta and her own clenched fruit. Not far away
        stand Adam and Eve, where we began.
        <br><br>
        Lalanne’s work is famous for its humor and
        whimsy, if not a certain surrealist bent.

    lifespan="1924 - 2019"

    description=`
      French artist Claude Lalanne is famous for her whimsical
      creations of sculpture, furniture and jewelry inspired by
      nature. Claude worked in side-by-side studios with her
      artist husband, Farnçois-Xavier Lalanne (1927–2008),
      for nearly half a century, and together they produced
      art under the collective name Les Lalanne. Her personal
      work often manifests itself in the form of decorative
      flora and she uses an electroplating technique to give
      her work a highly detailed metallic surface.
