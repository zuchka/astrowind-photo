        From the lobby of Sensei Lāna'i we see Fernando Botero's Adam and Eve. 
        Framed by the slender Cook Pines that give way to the resort, 
        each figure grasps an apple in one bulbous hand. 
        Together, they welcome guests to this special place: 
        Kō'ele, a royal land perched in clouds.
        <br><br>
        Typical of Fernando Botero's work, Adam and Eve are robust and solid, 
        but in a witty, zestful sort of way. 
        With soft, archaic smiles and contented postures, 
        they remind us that Kō'ele, like paradise, 
        is a place overflowing with life.

  <ArtistBio
    artist="FERNANDO BOTERO"
    lifespan="1932 - 2023"
    nationality="Columbian"
    description=`
        Fernando Botero’s signature style of creating sculptures
        with exaggerated and inflated features, suggesting
        political criticism and satire, coined a new term in the
        art world: “Boterismo.”
        <br><br>
        The Columbian artist, well known
        for representing women, men, daily life, and historical
        events with wit and irony, began his career as a painter
        experimenting with proportion and size with his
        paintings of round, corpulent humans, before switching
        to sculpture in the 1970s.
