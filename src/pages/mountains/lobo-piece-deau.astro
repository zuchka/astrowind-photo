        With Pièce d'Eau also known as Pond or Water
        Feature, we encounter another recumbent nude:
        the most fragmentary and dynamic one yet. She is
        perched on one hip while her torso twists toward
        us. 
        <br><br>
        There is something sensual and alive about
        this body. The balance that the figure achieves,
        up on that one haunch, is no less impressive than
        the balance Lobo strikes between abstraction and
        figuration.

      Baltasar Lobo was a Spanish artist known for his
      sculptures depicting the female form. He became part
      of the avant-garde in Paris, befriending Pablo Picasso
      and artist Henri Laurens and showing at galleries
      with Matisse and Leger. 
      <br><br>
      He was influenced by Paris’s modernist art scene as well as ancient art and sculpture,
      which is reflected in his abstract forms.
