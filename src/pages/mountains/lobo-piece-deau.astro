        With Pièce d'Eau also known as Pond or Water
        Feature, we encounter another recumbent nude:
        the most fragmentary and dynamic one yet. She is
        perched on one hip while her torso twists toward
        us. 
        <br><br>
        There is something sensual and alive about
        this body. The balance that the figure achieves,
        up on that one haunch, is no less impressive than
        the balance Lobo strikes between abstraction and
        figuration.
