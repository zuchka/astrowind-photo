        Emily Young’s stunning Cautha stands guard near the
        Onsen Garden. The clastic onyx, with its deep fissures
        and dark inclusions, reveals the eons that passed while
        this mineral took shape. With her eyes shut, Cautha
        gazes inwardly, as if she were contemplating the time
        and energy it took to create her own form. Be still with
        Cautha. Listen to the stream and examine the colored
        bands that streak across her somber face.
        <br><br>
        Cautha, incidentally, is the name of the Etruscan
        goddess of the sun. She is, then, a steward of energy,
        and an embodiment of it too, much like the ageless
        stone that Young has carved.

    lifespan="1952 - "
    nationality="British"
    description=`
      Born into a family of artists, British artist Emily Young
      trained first as a painter and then began carving stone
      in the early 1980s. Many of her sculptures are inspired
      by art of the ancient world and emphasize the natural
      beauty of raw stone. She creates meditative, figural
      works that speak to time, nature, memory and man’s
      relationship to the Earth.
