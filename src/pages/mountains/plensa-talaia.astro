        Approaching the rear of the lobby, beside the koi pond
        that borders Nobu, look toward the mountain and
        behold Jaume Plensa’s Talaia gazing back. Like Cautha,
        Talaia’s eyes are closed. And like so many other works
        here, Talaia too plays with scale and perspective. Her
        features, from this vantage point, appear elongated. But
        from the edges of the garden, Talaia’s distortions fade
        and she appears proportional.
        <br><br>
        This effect, anamorphosis, has a rich tradition in western
        art. By creating a skewed perspective that requires
        the viewer to assume a specific vantage point before
        the image resolves, Plensa’s Talaia encourages us to
        question how space and perspective mediate our world.

  <ArtistBio
    artist="JAUME PLENSA"
    lifespan="1955 - "
    nationality="Spanish"
    description=`
      Born in Barcelona, Jaume Plensa is best known for his
      sculptures of human faces, heads and figures. Much
      of his work is designed to be displayed and interacted
      with in public spaces as a means of unifying individuals.
      <br><br>
      Plensa frequently weaves words and numbers into his work. He also
      blends conventional materials with unconventional
      media such as water, light and sound as a reflection of
      energy and human connection.
