        Approaching the rear of the lobby, beside the koi pond
        that borders Nobu, look toward the mountain and
        behold Jaume Plensa’s Talaia gazing back. Like Cautha,
        Talaia’s eyes are closed. And like so many other works
        here, Talaia too plays with scale and perspective. Her
        features, from this vantage point, appear elongated. But
        from the edges of the garden, Talaia’s distortions fade
        and she appears proportional.
        <br><br>
        This effect, anamorphosis, has a rich tradition in western
        art. By creating a skewed perspective that requires
        the viewer to assume a specific vantage point before
        the image resolves, Plensa’s Talaia encourages us to
        question how space and perspective mediate our world.
