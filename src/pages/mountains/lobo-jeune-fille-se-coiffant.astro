        Baltasar Lobo often represented mothers and
        children. Before the first Hale we find Baltasar
        Lobo’s Young Girl Brushing Her Hair. The scene
        of a young woman at her toilette is a common one
        in Western art. Lobo’s friend and contemporary,
        Pablo Picasso, enjoyed the motif greatly.
        <br><br>
        Caressing her long, thickly plaited hair, we find
        this young woman engaged in self-care. There is
        a sense of nurturing in much of Lobo’s work; and
        nurturing is what one will always find inside these
        Hales.

      Baltasar Lobo was a Spanish artist known for his
      sculptures depicting the female form. He became part
      of the avant-garde in Paris, befriending Pablo Picasso
      and artist Henri Laurens and showing at galleries
      with Matisse and Leger. 
      <br><br>
      He was influenced by Paris’s modernist art scene as well as ancient art and sculpture,
      which is reflected in his abstract forms.
