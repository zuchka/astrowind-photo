        Walking towards the famed Donna Seduta, we
        follow her gaze. She is looking West, beyond
        Lāna'i Ranch and Keahiakawelo to the vast
        Pacific Ocean. Again, the figure grasps a smooth,
        unblemished apple.
        <br><br>
        Donna Seduta lounges on the edge of a massive
        Banyan tree. Note her stoic gaze and crooked
        grin, as if she were meditating under this cool canopy.

  <ArtistBio
    artist="FERNANDO BOTERO"
    lifespan="1932 - 2023"
    nationality="Columbian"
    description=`
      Fernando Botero’s signature style of creating sculptures
      with exaggerated and inflated features, suggesting
      political criticism and satire, coined a new term in the
      art world: “Boterismo.”
      <br><br>
      The Columbian artist, well known
      for representing women, men, daily life, and historical
      events with wit and irony, began his career as a painter
      experimenting with proportion and size with his
      paintings of round, corpulent humans, before switching
      to sculpture in the 1970s.
