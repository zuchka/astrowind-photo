        Ju Ming’s Tai Chi Arch gives way to Sensei’s Onsen
        Garden. From beneath the arch’s bronze span,
        smell the piquant betel nuts from the nearby
        grove of palms, and hear the water cascading
        down from the nearby onsen soaking pools. 
        <br><br>
        Tai Chi Arch, much like Botero’s Dancer’s, recalls that
        sense of being in one’s body—of being self-aware
        as one moves with great precision.

    artist="JU MING"
    lifespan="1938 - "
    nationality="Taiwanese"
    description=`
      At 15, Taiwanese artist Ju Ming trained as a woodcarver,
      setting the foundation for his future career as a sculptor.
      His work is characterized by large gestures, movement
      and strength and combines traditional and modern
      sculpture techniques. 
      <br><br>
      In his 30s, he took up tai chi,
      which became the inspiration for his famous 62-piece
      Tai Chi Series, a collection of abstract outdoor statues
      including Tai Chi Arch.
