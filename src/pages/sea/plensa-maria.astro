        Barcelona native, Jaume Plensa, expresses the beauty and complexity of the human figure, often in the form of heads and faces. 
        Like the Hawaiian Islands, this portrait of Maria is made of Basalt, a dense, black volcanic rock. 
        <br><br>
        Her face, captured in a three-quarter view, has been foreshortened to create an optical illusion which changes as you approach her.
