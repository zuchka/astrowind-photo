        This sculpture, by British-Indian artist Sir Anish Kapoor, is comprised of 97 stainless-steel spheres. The last in a series of five, the 
        Lāna’i Tall Tree is the tallest of its predecessors and has the most complex and effortless composition. 
        <br><br>
        Kapoor’s work explores mathematical, material, and structural principles in a wide range of materials- from mirror finish stainless-steel, 
        to the blackest of black powder pigments.
