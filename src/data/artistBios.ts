    description: `
      Fernando Botero's signature style of creating sculptures
      with exaggerated and inflated features, suggesting
      political criticism and satire, coined a new term in the
      art world: "Boterismo."
      <br><br>
      The Colombian artist, well known
      for representing women, men, daily life, and historical
      events with wit and irony, began his career as a painter
      experimenting with proportion and size with his
      paintings of round, corpulent humans, before switching
      to sculpture in the 1970s.
