      Fernando Botero's signature style of creating sculptures
      with exaggerated and inflated features, suggesting
      political criticism and satire, coined a new term in the
      art world: "Boterismo."
      <br><br>
      The Colombian artist, well known
      for representing women, men, daily life, and historical
      events with wit and irony, began his career as a painter
      experimenting with proportion and size with his
      paintings of round, corpulent humans, before switching
      to sculpture in the 1970s.

      Born in Barcelona, Jaume Plensa is best known for his
      sculptures of human faces, heads and figures. Much
      of his work is designed to be displayed and interacted
      with in public spaces as a means of unifying individuals.
      <br><br>
      Plensa frequently weaves words and numbers into his work. He also
      blends conventional materials with unconventional
      media such as water, light and sound as a reflection of
      energy and human connection.
